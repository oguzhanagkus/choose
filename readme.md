This is a project that I have coded at high school for fun.
Instead of choosing a student from paper, we had started to use this.
We ran this code on touchscreen board. It was more fairful and interactive method.
When a student was chosen, he/she will not be chosen again until every other students was chosen.

It reads studends from the txt file whose name is file.txt. It should be in same directory.
